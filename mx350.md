# MX350

## Motor upgrade

* I toss my old 500 or 650 dc motor in the 350.
* Need to weld on the foot mounts from the old motor and add some spacers but otherwise works well.

## Brakes

* My kid's hands were too small to pull the brake handle so I replaced the big one with [this smaller one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XXHL4ZS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
