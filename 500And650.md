# MX500, 650 and RSF650

## Kits

* [Loan Star Electrek](https://www.lonestarelectrek.com/?from=githubwiki) aka Gerardo
  * 3000w motor and 200a KVD7212NX controller
  * 48v 2000w motor and a KVD7212N controller
  * USPS flat rate shipping and insurance from a third party
* [Electro and Company](https://www.electroandcompany.com/buy-kits)
  * Kelly KVD7212NX controller with an additional heat sink(labeled as model Y and Model Z)
  * The my1020+ motor is manufactured by Kunray, currently the same as the 72v 3000w but with enlarged phase wires(6mm² vs 4mm²). See the section regarding larger phase wires [below](#Motors).

## Motors

* Brushless DC(BLDC) 1020 3000 watt
  * [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000250072388.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.21ef1802ozHCez), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09GP415RF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  * Almost a direct fit.  Uses the same mount hole pattern.
  * You just need to [drill](https://youtu.be/XgSiyZUIN8M) about 5mm down the cover of your motor to allow the bolt to rest flat so you can mount it.  Stop drilling once the bolt is flush with the top of the cover.  If you drill too deep you will need to do something hacky with washers n shit.  I think its these two bolts:
    * ![These two bolts I believe](./images/1020Motor.jpeg)

  * [This motor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000250072388.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.21ef1802ozHCez) has been verified to handle 250 phase amps and about 100 battery amps though it gets hot fast.  
  * If you push it hard
    * You'll need a heat sink like [this](http://www.pwmall.com/p-210643-50_126-delavan_heat_sink_fits_all_4_diameter_delavan_motors_7870_7970_7871_7971_fb_series) or [this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/223589500478?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=breea_81QKq&sssrc=2349624&ssuid=NRTq2ee0QjC&var=&widget_ver=artemis&media=COPY):
    * ![this](images/heatsink.jpeg)
    * You'll also want to consider **larger gauge phase** wires.  Larger gauge phase wires help with pushing higher current(amps) into the motor with less heat loss(power loss) to the motor.  Hot wires can mean an exponential loss of power to the motor. This is only necessary if you plan to push more than about 80 battery(continuous) amps.

* Feel free to put [your old motor in your kid's 350](./350s.md#motor-upgrade)
* [200w cheaper motor](https://www.ebay.com/itm/VEVOR-48V-2000W-Brushless-Motor-Kit-with-Controller-Grip-Key-and-3-Speed-Shifter-/164981974940?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&_trksid=p2349624.m46890.l49286&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&fbclid=IwAR1J5tH9lsmVjn5XcH6IyUKNE7UxO0cZbumSi2MqMLtC1J5cWQFaJ1VKYP0)
  * Not recommended if you plan on upgrading later
  * May be good if you are on a tight budget or don't want to go very fast(maybe a kid). Honestly, I would just stick with the stock motor at that rate.
  * Untested, I only got the 3000-watt motor.  I saw someone post this in a Facebook group and threw it in the wiki to open possibilities up for people.  
  
## Controllers

* Little focer([US](https://www.makerspev.com/products/little-focer-rev3-standard?fromB=yes), [worldwide](https://customwheel.shop/high-voltage-esc-motor-speed-controllers/little-focer-v3-esc-84v-20s?fromB=yes))
  * [Video of performance](https://youtu.be/tXv10vMjH2o)
  * [Follow the progress](https://forum.esk8.news/t/little-focer-84v-5kw-vesc-based-controller/50110?page=40)
  * Highly recommended.  100 battery amps and 250 phase amps, with proper cooling.  Bluetooth android app for super easy programming.
  * Works with [**brushed**](https://youtu.be/UhO5RmQlx1k) and **brushless** motors so you can upgrade your controller before even getting a brushless motor.
  * ![vesc tools](./images/vescUI.jpeg)  
* [80a](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09FHHZ9VM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  * Should be more waterproof than the VESC
* [Save some money on a Bluetooth adapter for Kelly controllers](https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=97113&p=1716759#p1716759)

## Battery

* [Electro and Company](https://www.electroandcompany.com/batteries) has a few to choose from
  * [The 24ah pack](https://www.electroandcompany.com/product-page/72v-24ah-li-ion-battery) has a 20s5p 21700 [tesla cell](https://www.batemo.de/products/batemo-cell-library/tesla-model-3/) configuration.
* [Eon Lithium](https://eonlithium.com?from=razorWiki)
* [Loose Screw](https://www.facebook.com/Loose-Screw-EV-102821932329712?from=razorWiki)
* [Greenway 48v battery](https://www.ebay.com/itm/255278257722)
* [50a battery](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V9LFNZK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1)
  * The charger sucks

## Throttle

* [Half twist key and volt display](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QF3MRHB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
  * The half twist is good for not accidentally sending your bike through your door when bringing your bike inside.  Happens more than you would think.
  * The display is hard to see in the sun.
  * Grips will smell like cancer forever no matter how hard you try to clean them off.  Best to pick up [some better grips](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08L4TGXGB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  I think those will work for the half twist size but might be a bit big.  I like locking grips(bolt to lock it on the handlebars).

## Brakes

* [Zoom bicycle brakes](https://www.amazon.com/Zoom-Shenzhen-Hydraulic-Brakes-Mountain/dp/B081XN2KJL/ref=sr_1_3?crid=SH58WS6BQGRH&keywords=zoom+brakes&qid=1645588479&s=sporting-goods&sprefix=zoom+brakes%2Csporting%2C137&sr=1-3)
  * I think those work.  Someone, please verify.
* I welded on some moped discs and calipers.  Works amazingly well and I never worry about heat.  

## Suspension fork

* The [sx500 fork](https://razor.com/products/replacement-parts/shop-by-product/electric-scooter-parts/sx500-front-fork/) seems like it won't work because they are different sizes than the MX and RSF forks.  
* The mx500 fork will work.  Good luck finding one that's in stock lolz.
* [Use mountain bike forks](mountainBikeForks.md)
* [No weld hydraulic fork upgrade](https://youtu.be/FWi3pJXr8CI)

## Rear shock

* MX
  * [165mm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FLTZ2ZS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for stock length
  * [190mm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D1X18JH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for a 2-inch lift
    * A bit stiff.  Try and find a lower lb spring.
    * You will want to add some length to the front fork as well.  **Someone add some deets for** this.**
  * SX
    * Stock length is 200mm 220 will give a nice lift
  * RSF
    * The stock length is 230?? Someone, please verify.

## Connectors

* [Small wire connectors](https://www.amazon.com/Swpeet-Automotive-Electrical-Connectors-Motorcycle/dp/B07DL6WRLP/ref=sr_1_6?crid=YVCEOCRL8ERG&keywords=2.8+with+terminals+Electrical+Wire+Connectors&qid=1645586926&sprefix=2.8+with+terminals+electrical+wire+connectors%2Caps%2C211&sr=8-6)([option 2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BJGVJRG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1))
  * Throttle, brake, and hall wires for example
  * `2.8 with terminals Electrical Wire Connectors` is what they are called.
  * This is what most controllers use.
  * You will need a [crimper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1RFZZ4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [XT90s](https://amzn.to/3BKHLG8) connectors for the battery are recommended to avoid sparking when plugging the battery into the controller.
  * Stick with the amass branded connectors.
  * They are rated for 100a.  If you have a 300a battery you can just use 3 connectors for example.
  * They can use up to [10 gauge silicone wire](https://amzn.to/3vbVEfs).  Any larger than that is a waste and hard to solder.
* [Bullet connectors](https://www.amazon.com/Generic-5-5mm-Gold-Bullet-Connector/dp/B01MRXLVRD/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=5.5mm+bullet+connector&qid=1645583504&sprefix=5.5mm+bull%2Caps%2C221&sr=8-4) for the motor phase wires.
  * See the image below for amp ratings.  I use 5.5mm bullets for everything because they do about 100 amps.  If I need more amps I just do 1 connector per phase per 100 amps.  I just match them up with the same number of [XT90s](https://amzn.to/3BKHLG8) connectors I use.  
    * ![amp ratings](./images/bullets.jpeg)
  * Depending on the controller you get you'll want to replace the phase wires to use bullet connectors so that you don't have to use one of these shit boxes:
    * ![shit boxes](./images/shitBox.jpeg)
  * The shit boxes are nothing but problems because the plastic melts easily when the nuts come loose.  I have seen this many times and it usually doesn't end well and can take your controller down with it.
  * If your controller has built-in phase wire mounts(like the one below) you should be fine to just go with what's built-in.
    * ![ok controller mount](./images/kelly.png)
  * [See this note regarding fuses](batteries.md#note-regarding-fuses)

## Tires

* Note that you will be looking for motorcycle tires because you have motorcycle rims.  Electric scooter-type tires measure the diameter from the outer tread of the tire.  Motorcycle tires measure the diameter of the rim.  Don't buy scooter tires unless they say moped scooter.
* Rear
  * You need a 10 inch
Rear tire 3-inch max-width for the rim
  * [Pirelli Angel Scooter Tires](https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/pirelli-angel-scooter-tires)
    * Pretty grippy on the road
    * Tubeless
    * Won't work with a heat sink without modifications
  * [MMG Bundle Combo Knobby Tire](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010TLKLLW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Front
12-inch front tire
  * Front tire 2.75 maybe 3-inch max-width for the rim
  * [16-inch scooter tire that's actually a 12-inch motorcycle tire](https://cart.electricscooterparts.com/16x3-0-all-terrain-tread-electric-street-scooter-tire)
    * Kinda like an 80/20 tire meaning 80% road and 20% off-road
    * Because this tire is so wide be very careful when installing it on the rim.  The rim is pretty weak and can bend easily.  Be sure to use [some tire lube](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H6HMPRK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
    * May have slightly less clearance but didn't bother me.
  * [Knobby Tire with Inner Tube 3.00-12 Front or Rear Trail Off Road Dirt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010TM2AYM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* How to and parts
  * [Good video](https://youtu.be/ToeaB1SpH2s)
  * Get [some tire lube](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01H6HMPRK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) if you plan to replace your own tires.  Makes it a million times easier.
  * [A tire bead tool](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O8RWF5Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) helps if you don't have someone to hold down your spoon
  * [These spoons](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QG0AKI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) are coo but honestly, it doesn't matter as long as you lube up the tire.
  * **Don't [bend your spoon too far](https://youtu.be/ToeaB1SpH2s?t=187)** or you'll pop your tube.  It's pretty much guaranteed.
